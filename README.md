**Internship Duration:** September 2023 - October 2023

## Project Highlights

- **Efficient Grade Management**: The Student Grade Calculator empowers educators to efficiently input and manage students' grades, assignments, and assessments in a user-friendly interface.

- **Real-time Analytics**: It provides real-time analytics and insights, allowing instructors to gain a deeper understanding of student performance through graphical representations and data visualization.

- **Using-Simple-data-types**: In this simple and basic project , I am using float and Int data-types to make it sure if only int data-type is used it can create an error while float can be used to handle the decimal values it easily.Values provided by using float data-type will be more accurate.
